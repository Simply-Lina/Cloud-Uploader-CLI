The inbetween (being a student and becoming a young professional)

    In the realm where textbooks lie,  
    Where dreams take flight and aspirations fly,  
    A student once, with eager eyes,  
    Embarked on life's grand, uncharted skies.

    But as the pages turned, and years rolled by,  
    The journey shifted, the stakes grew high.  
    From lecture halls to office doors,  
    A transition marked, by silent wars.

    In the realm where dreams collide,  
    The young professional must abide.  
    Beneath the weight of expectation's stare,  
    Lies a soul burdened, with silent despair.

    For in the shadows, unseen by most,  
    Lurks a battle, a relentless ghost.  
    Depression's grip, a heavy chain,  
    Binding hearts with endless pain.

    Yet still, amidst the darkest night,  
    A glimmer of hope, a flicker of light.  
    For in the heart of every fight,  
    Lies the strength to embrace the light.

    Through trials faced and battles won,  
    Comes the dawn, a new day begun.  
    For every struggle, every tear shed,  
    Shapes the soul, and forges ahead.

    So let us stand, with heads held high,  
    As we journey forth, beneath the sky.  
    For in the transition, from student to pro,  
    Lies the courage to rise, and let our spirits grow.
